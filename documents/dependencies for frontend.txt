For your **Emergency Medical System project**, hereâ€™s what I recommend for each prompt during the Next.js setup, tailored to the project's requirements:

---

### **Prompts and Recommendations**

#### **1. TypeScript**
- **Recommendation**: **Yes (Optional)**  
  - Reason: TypeScript provides type safety, which is helpful for larger projects like this. It can prevent bugs and improve maintainability, especially when working with APIs (like Google Maps) and dynamic data.  
  - If you're not comfortable with TypeScript, you can say **No** and use JavaScript.

---

#### **2. ESLint**
- **Recommendation**: **Yes**  
  - Reason: Helps maintain consistent and clean code, especially useful when collaborating or working on long-term projects.

---

#### **3. Tailwind CSS**
- **Recommendation**: **Yes**  
  - Reason: Tailwind CSS simplifies styling and is perfect for quickly designing responsive, visually appealing interfaces like your form and map display.

---

#### **4. `src/` Directory**
- **Recommendation**: **Yes**  
  - Reason: Keeps your project well-organized by separating source code (`src/`) from configuration files. It's ideal for larger projects.

---

#### **5. Experimental `app/` Directory**
- **Recommendation**: **No**  
  - Reason: Stick with the stable `pages/` directory for routing to avoid potential issues with experimental features.

---

#### **6. Import Aliases**
- **Recommendation**: **No**  
  - Reason: The default alias (`@/*`) is sufficient for most use cases. You can still set up custom aliases later if needed.

|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| TypeScript                                | **Yes (Optional)**  | Adds type safety for scalable development.  |
| ESLint                                    | **Yes**             | Enforces consistent and clean code.         |
| Tailwind CSS                              | **Yes**             | Simplifies and accelerates styling.         |
| `src/` Directory                          | **Yes**             | Organizes the project for better structure. |
| Experimental `app/` Directory             | **No**              | Stick with stable features for now.         |
| Custom Import Alias                       | **No**              | Default alias is sufficient for most uses.  |
