This sounds like an impactful project! Here's a high-level plan and some suggestions for the backend:

---

### **1. Backend Framework**
You can use **Node.js** with **Express.js** for your backend. It's simple, fast, and integrates well with Next.js/React. Other options:
- **Python with Flask/Django**
- **GoLang** for high performance
- **Ruby on Rails** for rapid development

I recommend Node.js since it pairs seamlessly with your frontend tech stack.

---

### **2. Features to Implement**
#### **Frontend Integration**:
- Form for entering details like address, emergency type, etc.
- Display emergency location and shortest path using Google Maps.

#### **Backend Responsibilities**:
- Handle data submissions securely.
- Integrate with APIs for:
  - Geocoding (convert addresses to lat/lon).
  - Shortest path/directions.
  - Sending notifications to hospitals.

#### **APIs to Use**:
1. **Google Maps Platform** (Free tier available):
   - **Geocoding API**: Convert address to coordinates.
   - **Directions API**: Get the shortest path.
   - **Places API**: Fetch nearby hospitals.
   
2. **Alternatives (if needed)**:
   - **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** with **GraphHopper** or **OSRM** for routing.
   - **Here Maps API** for geolocation and routing.

3. **Notification APIs**:
   - **Twilio** (for SMS notifications).
   - **SendGrid** (for email notifications).
   - **Pushbullet** or **Firebase** for push notifications.

---

### **3. Workflow**
1. **Frontend Form**: User enters details (address, emergency type).
2. **Backend Endpoint**:
   - Receive form data.
   - Geocode the address.
   - Fetch nearby hospitals.
   - Calculate the shortest path to the nearest hospital.
   - Trigger notifications to hospitals.
3. **Frontend Map View**:
   - Fetch data from the backend.
   - Display the route and hospital location on Google Maps.

---

### **4. Database**
For pre-fed hospital data:
- Use **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** to store hospital details (name, coordinates, services, etc.).

---

### **5. Basic Code Outline**
#### Backend (Node.js/Express):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/emergency', async (req, res) => {
    const { address, details } = req.body;

    try {
        // 1. Geocode the address
        const geocodeResp = await axios.get(`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=${encodeURIComponent(address)}&key=YOUR_API_KEY`);
        const { lat, lng } = geocodeResp.data.results[0].geometry.location;

        // 2. Find nearby hospitals
        const hospitalsResp = await axios.get(`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/json?location=${lat},${lng}&radius=5000&type=hospital&key=YOUR_API_KEY`);
        const hospitals = hospitalsResp.data.results;

        // 3. Get directions to the nearest hospital
        const nearestHospital = hospitals[0]; // Assuming first result is nearest
        const directionsResp = await axios.get(`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin=${lat},${lng}&destination=place_id:${nearestHospital.place_id}&key=YOUR_API_KEY`);
        const route = directionsResp.data.routes[0];

        // 4. Respond with data
        res.json({
            emergencyLocation: { lat, lng },
            nearestHospital: nearestHospital.name,
            directions: route
        });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        res.status(500).send("Error handling emergency");
    }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Backend running on port 3000'));
```

#### Frontend:
- Use `react-google-maps/api` for embedding Google Maps and drawing routes.

---

### **6. Next Steps**
1. Set up your backend environment and integrate APIs.
2. Design your frontend form and map components.
3. Pre-fill the database with hospital data or rely on live API calls.
4. Test with real-world scenarios.
