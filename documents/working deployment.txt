To run your full-stack project with a **Node.js** backend, **MongoDB** as the database, and a **Next.js** frontend, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Install Dependencies**
Ensure that all required dependencies for the backend and frontend are installed.

#### **Backend Setup (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**
1. Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/backend
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This installs all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. Check for environment variables:
   - Ensure you have a `.env` file in the backend directory with the necessary configurations. For example:
     ```env
     PORT=3001
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
     JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
     ```
   - Replace `MONGO_URI` with your MongoDB connection string.

---

#### **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/frontend
   ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Check for environment variables:
   - Ensure thereâ€™s a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with configurations like:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
     ```

---

### **2. Start MongoDB**
Ensure MongoDB is running on your machine. You can start it in different ways depending on your setup.

#### **Local MongoDB**
- Start the MongoDB service:
  ```bash
  mongod
  ```
- Verify it's running by connecting to the MongoDB shell:
  ```bash
  mongo
  ```

#### **Cloud MongoDB (Optional)**
If you are using **MongoDB Atlas**:
1. Copy your connection string from the Atlas dashboard.
2. Update `MONGO_URI` in the backend `.env` file.

---

### **3. Run the Backend**
1. In the backend directory, start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   If you are using `nodemon` for hot-reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:3001` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

3. Verify the backend is working:
   - Use a tool like **Postman** or **curl** to test an endpoint, for example:
     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3001/api/test
     ```

---

### **4. Run the Frontend**
1. In the frontend directory, start the Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. The frontend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the application.

---

### **5. Verify the Integration**
- Ensure the backend API and frontend are correctly integrated:
  - Frontend API calls should use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` value (`http://localhost:3001/api`).
  - Test features like form submissions or database interactions to verify everything works.

---

### **6. Common Issues and Debugging**
1. **Backend Not Connecting to MongoDB**:
   - Verify that `MONGO_URI` is correct and MongoDB is running.
   - Check for logs in the backend console.

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - Ensure the backend allows requests from the frontend by adding CORS middleware in `app.js`:
     ```javascript
     const cors = require('cors');
     app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000', credentials: true }));
     ```

3. **Environment Variable Errors**:
   - Ensure `.env` and `.env.local` files are properly set up and accessible.

4. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Ensure no other services are using ports `3000` or `3001`. You can change these in the `.env` files or package scripts.

---

### **7. Deployment (Optional)**
For production:
- Deploy the backend to a server (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or a VPS).
- Deploy the Next.js app to a hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
- Use a managed MongoDB instance like MongoDB Atlas for hosting your database.
