4. Explore Free Alternatives
If you’re unable to provide a valid payment method, you can consider alternatives:

OpenStreetMap (OSM):
OSM is a free, open-source mapping service. You can use libraries like Leaflet.js to integrate maps into your application.
While it doesn’t provide as many features as Google Maps (like Directions or Places API), it’s a great free alternative.
Mapbox Free Tier:
Mapbox offers a generous free tier, and it doesn’t require a balance to sign up.
